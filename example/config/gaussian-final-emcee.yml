## gaussian-emcee.yml
# ez-emcee configuration file to estimate the mean and standard deviation of a gaussian distribution, with all possible configuration arguments


# The names of the parameters
# Must match the names defined in the stan model file!
names: [mu, sigma]

# The labels to show in the plots and tables, for each parameter.
# Defaults to the name of each parameter if not provided.
# Latex is supported.
labels: [\mu, \sigma]

# Initial condition for each parameter, for each walker.
# Must be inside the model restrictions, otherwise it might crash.
# The most relevant initial conditions implemented in this program are:
# - gauss(mu, sigma)
# - uniform(a, b)
# - float(a)
initial:
  mu: uniform(-10, 10)
  sigma: uniform(1, 10)

# Line markers to show rendered in the plots.
# These are optional and can be used to represent the true or expected values.
markers:
  mu: 2
  sigma: 3

# Autocorreation time must change less than this percentage to consider convergence.
percentage: 50

# Number of steps to sample the posterior distribution, after the convergence is met.
samples: 1000

# Number of steps to check if convergence is met.
# Defaults to 1000 steps.
check: 250

# Maximum number of steps to compute, regardless if the chain has converged or not.
# Must be larger than the number of steps to compute.
# Defaults to 100.000 steps.
maxsteps: 250000

# The number of walkers to sample the likelihood.
# Defaults to 32 walkers.
walkers: 16

# The number of processes to spawn to make use of multi core processors.
# Defaults to all available hardware threads.
processes: 4
